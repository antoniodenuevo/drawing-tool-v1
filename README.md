I created this tool as a way to create for myself—a balance between organic drawing and controlled choices.

Built with p5.js, the program uses vector math to dynamically adjust the brush size based on drawing speed, adding a natural fluidity to the strokes.

To maintain visual consistency while allowing creative freedom, I implemented a set of ‘style guides’ that help structure color choices without restricting expression.
